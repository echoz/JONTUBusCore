NTUBusArrival
=============

For want of a better name, this project basically abstracts the shuttle bus timings as well as other relevant data into Objective-C objects that can be used. It abstracts the need to send XHML HTTP requests to the StreetDirectory webservice and/or the parsing of the actual index page to get details like the bus stops and routes.
